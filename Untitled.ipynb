    "### Project Steps Overview\n",
    "Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks in this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: Assessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3: Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4: Storing data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 6: Reporting\n",

    "### The Data\n",
    "In this project, you will work on the following three datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhanced Twitter Archive**\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Predictions File**\n",
    "\n",
    "One more cool thing: I ran every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs*. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
    "This file (image_predictions.tsv) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. It is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional data from the Twitter API**\n",
    "Gather each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at the minimum and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file."
